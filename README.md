# Movie Theater Seating Challenge

This assingment implements an algorithm for assigning seats within a movie theater to fulfill reservation requests. The movie theater is assumed to have a 10 row by 20 seat layout. The goal of this is to write a program that maximizes customer satisfaction and customer safety, during COVID-19 times. There must be a buffer of three seets and/or one row between groups.

## Assumptions

There were several assumptions I made for this program.

* I did some research and concluded that the most desirable seats in a movie theater are the middle-back seats, and the middle seats in general. With this in mind, I assigned weights to the movie theater seats.

I also assumed that every seat cost the same amount.
